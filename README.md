# 🏗️ JugnooCRM: Easy Project & Finance Management

## 👋 What is JugnooCRM?
JugnooCRM is a simple, powerful tool designed to help you manage your entire business workflow in one place. It handles everything from creating accurate client estimates and tracking inventory to monitoring your project finances and profits. It replaces messy paper notes and complex spreadsheets with a clean, easy-to-use digital system.

## 🚀 How It Works (The Core Loop)
The app follows the natural flow of your business:
1.  **Log In**: Securely access your dashboard.
2.  **Create Client**: Add a new customer and auto-capture their location.
3.  **Generate Estimate**: Build a quote using your real-time inventory.
4.  **Track Profit**: Watch your project financials update automatically as you work.

## 🎨 App Tour: What You See (Aesthetics & Layout)
*   **Overall Look**: A professional, immersive **Dark Mode** interface (Deep Blue/Black background) that is easy on the eyes and looks modern.
*   **Key Colors**:
    *   **Background**: Deep dark blue (`#0E1117`) for a unified look.
    *   **Cards**: Lighter gray panels (`#262730`) with subtle borders to make your data pop.
    *   **Text**: Crisp white text for readability, with muted labels.
*   **Navigation**: A simple sidebar menu with **7 clear tabs** (Dashboard, New Client, Estimator, Inventory, Suppliers, P&L, Settings) lets you switch between tasks instantly.

## 💡 Key Features Explained

### 1. The Estimator Engine (Your Quote Generator)
*   **Goal**: Quickly create accurate client quotes without doing math in your head.
*   **The Math**: The system handles all the complex calculations. **Crucially, all final prices are automatically rounded UP to the nearest ₹100.** This simplifies billing and avoids dealing with loose change.
*   **Margins**: You can set standard profit margins for Parts, Labor, and Extras. For special projects, you can override these with custom sliders.
*   **Safety Check**: The app watches your stock. If you try to quote for 10 items but only have 5, it gives you a **Low Stock Warning** immediately.

### 2. Financial Controls
*   **P&L (Profit & Loss)**: This tab acts as your business health monitor. It features **7 interactive charts** (including Bar, Pie, Scatter, Line, and Radar charts) to visualize Revenue, Expenses, Client Profitability, and Business Health. It also tracks your **Outstanding Amount** and Net Cash Profit in real-time.
*   **Advance Calculation**: No more guessing how much advance to ask for. The built-in calculator automatically figures out the minimum advance needed to cover your material costs plus a 10% profit buffer.

### 3. Inventory & Purchasing
*   **Inventory**: Your digital warehouse. Track exactly what you have in stock and what it costs (Base Rate).
*   **Purchasing**: When you buy new stock from suppliers, simply log it in the app. The system automatically adds the quantity to your stock and updates the item's cost price to the new rate.

### 4. Client Management & Workflow
*   **Dashboard**: Your command center. See a list of all active clients, check their status (e.g., "Order Received"), and make quick updates.
*   **Geolocation**: Forget asking for directions. When adding a new client, one click captures their exact GPS location and creates a Google Maps link for your team.
